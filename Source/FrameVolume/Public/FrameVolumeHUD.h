/**
 * The counters box for FrameVolume, drawn on UCanvas from AHUD.
 *
 * Canvas rather than UMG, and there are deliberately no buttons on it. Two reasons, pulling the same way:
 *
 *   - This box has to survive a cooked Shipping build. DrawDebug is compiled out there and a debug widget
 *     is usually stripped; a Canvas overlay is not. It is a real overlay, not a development one.
 *
 *   - Anything that has to be *clicked* belongs in UMG instead. An AHUD hit box is tested against
 *     UGameViewportClient::GetMousePosition(), which reports nothing at all on a machine with no mouse
 *     attached - a capture rig, a build agent, a headless test - so the click never lands. Widgets are
 *     not affected. The numbers live here, where they cost nothing and always draw; controls live in a
 *     widget, where they always receive the click.
 *
 * A project that already has a HUD class does not have to reparent it: turn on
 * bAutoDrawStatsOnAnyHUD in Project Settings and the same box is drawn through AHUD::OnHUDPostRender
 * instead. The two paths know about each other and cannot stack.
